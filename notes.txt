first we have created a folder MERN
inside that folder we have created a folder server
inside the server folder, run npm init -y to generate package.json 
after that, run npm i express

now create a file server.js

The first line const express = require("express"); is using Node.js's require function to import the Express.js module. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. The require function is used to import modules in Node.js. The imported module is then assigned to the express constant.

The second line const app = express(); is calling the imported express function to create a new Express application. This app object has methods for routing HTTP requests, configuring middleware, rendering HTML views and registering a template engine.

app.get() is used to set the routes...like what response the server will send if the particular url is being requested.

then we are setting the PORT number to 5000 and defining app.listen() function to listen the requests comming from port 5000.

Now, npm i nodemon which 
automatically restarts the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

Now we will use nodemon server.js command to run the server
